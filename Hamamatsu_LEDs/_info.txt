- Light source: Ledmotive Spectra Tune Lab (10 LEDs)
- Sample: Edmund Optics diffuse white reflectance target (size: 30 cm x 30 cm; material: Spectralon; reflectance: 99%)
- Measurement device: Hamamatsu PMA-12 fiber spectrometer

- measurement geometry: 0/45
- exposure time = 95 ms
- averaging = 10 spectra

- each LED's emission spectrum was measured separately (at full power)
- dark noise spectrum has been subtracted from measured spectra
